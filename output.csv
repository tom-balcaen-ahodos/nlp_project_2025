Dear Sir/Madam,

The flame for the art of cooking will be lit again in exactly 261 days on the grounds of Messe Stuttgart. Chefs from all over the world compete at the IKA/Culinary Olympics and cook in a fair competition for gold, silver and bronze, as well as the recognition of the entire industry. The 26th IKA will take place from 2 to 7 February 2024 and for the second time in parallel with INTERGASTRA - the leading trade fair for the hotel and gastronomy business.
